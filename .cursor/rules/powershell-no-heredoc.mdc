description: Prevent bash heredoc syntax in shell commands — user runs PowerShell on Windows
alwaysApply: true

# PowerShell Shell Environment

This user runs **Windows with PowerShell**. Bash-only syntax is not supported.

## Forbidden: Heredoc syntax

Never use bash heredoc (`<<EOF`, `<<'EOF'`) in shell commands. PowerShell does not support it.

```bash
# ❌ BAD — will fail in PowerShell
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat: add new feature

Some description here.
EOF
)"
```

## Correct alternatives

### Simple commit messages — pass directly with `-m`

```powershell
# ✅ GOOD — single-line
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
```

### Multi-line commit messages — use backtick-n for newlines

```powershell
# ✅ GOOD — multi-line using PowerShell line continuation
git commit -m "feat: add new feature`n`nSome description here."
```

### Other multi-line strings — use PowerShell here-strings

```powershell
# ✅ GOOD — PowerShell here-string (note: @" must be at end of line, "@ at start)
$body = @"
This is a
multi-line string
"@
```

## General rule

Always use PowerShell-compatible syntax for all shell commands. When in doubt, prefer simple inline strings over any heredoc or subshell construct.
